- ðŸŽ¨ I am desperately trying to clear my [pile of shame](https://www.google.com/search?q=pile+of+shame+definition&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS931US931&sxsrf=AB5stBj1lr75OxSLt4Z-Y-u8-SZnfJ7H8g%3A1690163186518&ei=8te9ZO6hH_vC0PEP0oeamAQ&ved=0ahUKEwju4uDCnKaAAxV7ITQIHdKDBkMQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=pile+of+shame+definition&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGHBpbGUgb2Ygc2hhbWUgZGVmaW5pdGlvbjIGEAAYFhgeMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgMyCBAAGIoFGIYDSOAZUJUPWLgYcAN4AZABAJgBigGgAdUGqgEDOC4yuAEDyAEA-AEBwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA8ICBRAhGKABwgIFECEYqwLCAggQIRgWGB4YHeIDBBgAIEGIBgGQBgU&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).

- âš¡ Fun fact: In Path Of Exile, damage over time is stored in a 32-bit signed integer, so the maximum damage per tick for a DoT damage instance is [~35.8 million damage per second](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Damage_over_time).
